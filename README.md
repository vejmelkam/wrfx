WRF-x
====

WRF configuration and execution manager based on preconfigured profiles.

Configuration
-------------
The idea is to combine namelist.input and namelist.wps from several "computational profiles"
that basically correspond to namelists in WRF.

The configuration options (namelist items) will be obtained in an automated way by parsing the entries in the Registry.
